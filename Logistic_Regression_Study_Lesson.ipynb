    "## 1. What is logistic regression? \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a supervised learning method to model the relationship between a categorical outcome (dependent variable) and one or more independent variable. The independent variables or explanatory variables can be discrete and/or continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic function was invented in the 19TH century for the description of growth of human populations and the course of autocatalytic chemical reactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is not a typical linear regression model. It belongs to the family of GLMs. Some of the things to notice about the logistic regression: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Logistic regression does not assume a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. It's linear in parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The dependent variable must be categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. the independent variables need not be normally distributed, nor linearly related, nor of equal variance within each group, and lastly, the categories (groups) must be mutually exclusive and exhaustive. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The logistic regression has the power to accommodate both categorical and continuous independent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Although the power of the analysis is increased if the independent variables are normally distributed and do have a linear relationship with the dependent variable.\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic regression is easier to implement, interpret, and very efficient to train.\t\n",
    "\n",
    "* It makes no assumptions about distributions of classes in feature space.\t\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can easily extend to multiple classes(multinomial regression) and a natural probabilistic view of class predictions.\t\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* It not only provides a measure of how appropriate a predictor(coefficient size)is, but also its direction of association (positive or negative).\t\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is very fast at classifying unknown records.\t\n",
    "\n",
    "* Good accuracy for many simple data sets and it performs well when the dataset is linearly separable.\t\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can interpret model coefficients as indicators of feature importance.\t\n",

    "* Logistic regression is less inclined to over-fitting but it can overfit in high dimensional datasets.One may consider Regularization (L1 and L2) techniques to avoid over-fitting in these scenarios.\t"

    "\n",
    "The binary dependent variable has the values of 0 and 1 and the predicted value (probability) must be bounded to fall within the same range. To define a relationship bounded by 0 and 1, the logistic regression uses the logistic curve to represent the relationship between the independent and dependent variable. At very low levels of the independent variable, the probability approaches 0, but never reaches 0. Likewise, if the independent variable increases, the predicted values increase up the curve and approach 1 but never equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic transformation ensures that estimated values do not fall outside the range of 0 and 1. This is achieved in two steps, firstly the probability is re-stated as odds which is defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring. For example, if a horse has a probability of 0.8 of winning a race, the odds of it winning are 0.8/(1 − 0.8) = 4:1. To constrain the predicted values to within 0 and 1, the odds value can be converted back into a probability; thus,\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\text { Probability (event) }=\\frac{\\text { odds(event) }}{1+\\text { odds(event) }}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It can therefore be shown that the corresponding probability is 4/(1 + 4) = 0.8. Also, to keep the odds values form going below 0, which is the lower limit (there is no upper limit), the logit value which is calculated by taking the logarithm of the odds, must be computed. Odds less than 1 have a negative logit value, odds ratio greater than 1.0 have positive logit values and the odds ratio of 1.0 (corresponding to a probability of 0.5) have a logit value of 0."
